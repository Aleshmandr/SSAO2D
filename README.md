# SSAO2D

This is an updated version of my old [asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/ssao2d-82726) from the Unity Asset Store with URP support. Includes Built-In and URP example.

SSAO2D provides additional level of visual quality by simulating soft ambient light shadows in 2D space. It accentuates local geometric detail and produces shadows by nearby occluding surfaces.

Note! This effect based on ZDepth so it does NOT works correctly with default sprite shader or any transparent objects!
