Thank you for buying SSAO2D, I hope you'll like it!

Usage: To add SSAO2D to your scene select your camera add component SSAO2D.cs onto it.

Note! This effect based on ZDepth so it does NOT works correctly with default sprite shader or any transparent objects!
Two rewrited standard shaders for unlit and transparent objects with enabled writing to Z buffer are included in the project.
If you are using sprites - use UnlitCutoutZWrite shader on sprite material.

Intensity: This parameter adjusts the overall intensity of the shadows.
Spread: This value determines shadow spread distance.
Offset: This value determines shadows offset from their caster.
Cutoff: This value limits how far objects can cast a shadow.
Threshold: This value determines minimum distance for shadow casting.
